<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm <strong>Swayam S. Rathod</strong>, an engineering student from the vibrant city of Bangalore. I’m currently studying at <strong>SATP, Tahiri</strong>, where I’m building a strong foundation in technology, problem-solving, and creative thinking.</p>

<p>From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by how websites work—from the design to the code behind the scenes. This curiosity led me to explore the world of <strong>web development</strong>, and ever since, I’ve been deeply passionate about turning simple ideas into fully functional digital experiences.</p>

<p>My goal is to become a professional <strong>web developer</strong> and also work independently as a <strong>freelancer</strong>. I love the flexibility and creativity that freelancing offers, and I’m eager to collaborate with clients, startups, or teams to bring their visions to life through clean, responsive, and modern web designs.</p>

<p>I’m continuously learning and improving my skills in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and other modern web technologies. I also have a growing interest in UI/UX design, which helps me focus on building websites that don’t just work—but feel great to use.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy exploring tech trends, working on side projects, and contributing to online communities. I believe in lifelong learning, and every project I work on is a step toward becoming the best version of myself—both personally and professionally.</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone who is driven, detail-oriented, and excited about technology, I’d love to connect. Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
